If you're release manager, you can issue GPG-inline signed command:

* `Upload @COMPONENT@ @COMMIT_SHA@ @RELEASE_NAME@ current repo` (available 7 days from now)
* `Upload @COMPONENT@ @COMMIT_SHA@ @RELEASE_NAME@ current (dists) repo`, you can choose subset of distributions, like `vm-fc24 vm-fc25` (available 7 days from now)
* `Upload @COMPONENT@ @COMMIT_SHA@ @RELEASE_NAME@ security-testing repo`

Above commands will work only if packages in current-testing repository were built from given commit (i.e. no new version superseded it).
